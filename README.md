# Personal macOS dotfile setup

Hi, I'm Jason. I'm a web developer that likes to sometimes fake being a designer. So secretly, my first love will always be preserved for HTML and CSS. Over the last decade, I've primarily worked with the LAMP stack, making a living selling commercial WordPress products. Also, like all web developers, I've done my best to keep up with the evolving world of JavaScript. I currently spend a lot of time with NodeJS and the MERN stack.

With that context of who I am and what I do, feel free to peruse my personal dotfile setup.
